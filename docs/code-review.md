# Code Review

This category evaluates an agent's ability to **review** a Business Central (AL) pull request. Given a diff, the agent produces structured review comments, which are scored against an expected (gold) set of findings.

Unlike the pass/fail categories, code review is scored with **Precision / Recall / F1** over the matched comments. Expected and generated comments are paired by a globally optimal (one-to-one) assignment on file and line proximity (within a configured line tolerance), and a pair is only counted as *matched* when an LLM judge confirms the two describe the same underlying issue. Matched comments are additionally scored on how closely the agent's **severity** classification tracks the expected severity.

## Experiment Leaderboard

Compares review-knowledge configurations for the same model (see the Baseline Leaderboard above for the plain agent):

- **Inline knowledge (pre-#8700)** — the review checklists BCApps shipped inline before adopting BCQuality, injected as custom instructions.
- **BCQuality (live skills)** — the agent dynamically consumes the live BCQuality skill tree.

## How metrics are computed

- **Precision** — of the comments the agent generated, the fraction that matched an expected finding. Penalizes noisy reviews.
- **Recall** — of the expected findings, the fraction the agent caught. Penalizes missed issues.
- **F1** — harmonic mean of precision and recall; balances both equally (the β=1 case of Fβ).
- **Fβ (β=0.5)** — precision-leaning F-score; use when false positives are costly (noisy reviews waste reviewer time).
- **Fβ (β=2)** — recall-leaning F-score; weights catching issues more than avoiding noise.
- **Severity MAE** — mean absolute error between the agent's and the expected severity levels, over matched comments only. Lower is better; `0` means every matched comment got the severity exactly right.
- **Valid output rate** — fraction of tasks whose output parsed into a structured review. Failures score zero on every other metric. (Reported per run.)
- **Micro vs. Macro** — *Micro* sums matched/generated/expected across all tasks (tasks with many comments dominate); *Macro* averages per-task scores (every task counts equally).
- **95% CI** — confidence interval bootstrapped over the per-task F1 scores, so the leaderboard reports sampling uncertainty even for a single run. The micro `F1` CI resamples runs; the `Macro F1` CI resamples tasks.
